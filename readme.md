Simple Bugtracker
=================

This is a simple bug tracker written using node.js, it uses Express for web serving and PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Setup

This project was developed on node.js v18.19.0 (Straight from the Debian repo at the time of writing) and PostgreSQL 15.6. Run `npm install` to install all required packages and `npm run start` to start the project with everything loaded.

## TBC

This readme.md will be expanded upon as the project progresses.
