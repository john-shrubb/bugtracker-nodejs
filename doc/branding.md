# Branding

Even if this project is more of a personal portfolio project and not really intended for commercial use (Although I won't stop you if you do choose to deploy it in a commercial manner), I have decided on "Troubletracker" as the branding that will be used on the front end.

## Naming

As shown above, the branding for the stock version of the front end is _TroubleTracker_.
I simply chose this as it was the first creative and relevant name I could think of.

## Logo

I've gone for a pretty simple logo, with some simple text and a logo.

<img style="width: 800px; height: auto;" src="./.assets/TroubleTracker.svg">

This can be cut down to only the logo:

<img style="width: 300px; height: auto;" src="./.assets/TroubleTracker-Icon.svg">

## Rebranding

Anyone can rebrand the front end and put their own label/brandname on it.
