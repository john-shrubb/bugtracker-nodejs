Branding
========

Even if this project is more of a personal portfolio project and not really intended for commercial use (Although I won't stop you if you do choose to deploy it in a commercial manner), I have decided on "Troubletracker" as the branding that will be used on the front end.

## Naming

As shown above, the branding for the stock version of the front end is *TroubleTracker*.
I simply chose this as it was the first creative and relevant name I could think of.

## Colour Scheming

Here are my current ideas for the colour palette represented below:

<!--
The line height for the font used in Github MD means that the bottom padding looks smaller than it should.
Resolved by using 7px rather than 5px. 

This should not become an issue in the actual front end.
-->
<style>
	.small-tag {
		padding: 5px 10px 7px 10px;
		border-radius: 3px;
		color: #ffffff;
		background: #303030;
	}
</style>


<p class="small-tag" style="background: #d17408;">Primary</p>
<p class="small-tag" style="background: #f0a146;">Secondary</p>
<p class="small-tag" style="background: #a5a5a5; color: black;">Light Gray</p>
<p class="small-tag">Dark Gray</p> <!--.small-tag should just default to Dark Gray.-->

More colours, such as error, information, warning etc. will be added later.

## Logo

I've gone for a pretty simple logo, with some simple text and a logo.

<img style="width: 800px; height: auto;" src="./.assets/TroubleTracker.svg">


This can be cut down to only the logo:

<img style="width: 300px; height: auto;" src="./.assets/TroubleTracker-Icon.svg">

## Rebranding

Anyone can rebrand the front end and put their own label/brandname on it.
